```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Embedded Shiny Application.

It seems that embedding shiny app into RMD is not that a good idea:

```{r tabsets, echo=FALSE}
shinyAppDir('Shinyapps_IO')
```

Is it acceptable to let users run shiny app directly by opening the file and 
clicking the button?
